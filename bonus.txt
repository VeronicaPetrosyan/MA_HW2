Use the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) algorithm to the experiment.

Epsilon-Greedy explores randomly. UCB1 uses confidence intervals to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively. It will reduce regret over time and make smarter exploration decisions based on uncertainty. It will be especially useful when the number of trials is limited.
